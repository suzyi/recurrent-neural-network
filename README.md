# Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is actually a first-order Hidden Markov Model (HMM)
$$h_t=f(x_t,h_{t-1};\theta),y_t = g(h_t;\theta)$$

used mainly for time series analysis.
## dataset
Time series:
+ From Google stocks, you can get Tesla Stock price.
+ Lorenz system.
+ KS equation
## define a simple RNN unit
## Vanilla
## LSTM
## GRU
## seq2seq
autoregressive seq2seq, acts as an autoencoder.
## Echo State T(EST), reservoir-computing
This project is intended to implement the prediction of chaotic system via reservoir-computing technique.
