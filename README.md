# Recurrent Neural Network
Recurrent Neural Network is used mainly for time series analysis.
## dataset
Time series:
+ From Google stocks, you can get Tesla Stock price.
+ Lorenz system.
+ KS equation
## define a simple RNN unit
## Vanilla
## LSTM
## GRU
## seq2seq
autoregressive seq2seq, acts as an autoencoder.
## Echo State T(EST), reservoir-computing
This project is intended to implement the prediction of chaotic system via reservoir-computing technique.
